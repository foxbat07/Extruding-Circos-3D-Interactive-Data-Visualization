# Extruding-Circos-3D-Interactive-Data-Visualization
Welcome to the Extruding-Circos-3D-Interactive-Data-Visualization wiki!

The design has been inspired by Circos (circos.ca) a data visualization tool used to visualize relationships.

I intend to extrude the circle into a spiral thereby utilizing the third dimension to represent time. I have chosen bright blue for the spiral staircase with fine lines to demarcate the days. Each step represents a month. The background is black. I have color coded each language, and each book ( cin & cout ) is represented by an arc of that color. Obviously the checkout is lower in position than the check-in. The height of the arc is governed by how long the book has been checked out for.I have used ControlP5 for adding a graphical user interface for interaction and used peasycam for exploration in 3D space.

This visualization allows individuals who are not familiar with SPL to interact with the data and explore the trends in programming languages and draw there own conclusions. The aim is not to visualize anomalous data, instead to educate people on current trends and possible predictions.
